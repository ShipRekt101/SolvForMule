Overview-
This is a tool on your TI-84 calculator that solves math problems for you. For example, if you wanted to find the surface area
of a Rectangular Prisim, instead of using the whole formula and typing it out, you can go to the program and type in the measures
like length, width and height, and it will give you the answer. I have provided screenshots of the programs in action and you can 
check them out.
